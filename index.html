    <h1>LIMPIN. This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into a pink color</h1>
    <h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into purple color</h2>
    <h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into a sky blue color</h3>
    <p1>This is a <em>paragraph</em> As you can see, I placed an emphasis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color to green, all with just CSS.</p1>
    <p2>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p2>
    <ul>
        <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
        <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
        <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript</p>
    <p>First number: <span id="firstNum">11</span> <br></p>
    <p>Second number: <span id="secondNum">12</span> </p>
    <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <strong id="answer" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">(placeholder for the answer)</strong></p>
    <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
